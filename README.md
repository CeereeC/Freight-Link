# Solution
## Freight-Link

My team's idea was to create an app to promote collaboration between Freight Providers and Users.   
The first part of the app is a live chat feature that allows users to collaborate in real time.   
The second part is a Blockchain network on which exchange of freight containers and vehicles takes place.  
In this system, freight containers and vehicles are tokenized and exchanged on a blockchain.  

The chat feature was built using Socket.io and the Blockchain Network hosted on the [Xooa Blockchain Asset Management API](https://api.xooa.com/explorer/#!/Asset_Management/Asset_Create).

Built in 2 Days using ReactJS, MongoDB
