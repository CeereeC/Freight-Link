## Optimization of Logistics Eco-System within the Container Freight Station (CFS)

Keppel Distripark, a Container Freight Station (CFS), is a multi-tenanted distripark, comprises of 43 warehouse units. There are 24 tenants/operators in the CFS, and they handle a total of ~300,000 TEUs (or ~200,000 containers) of import and export containers per year.

The tenants’ appointed hauliers will pick up the empty containers from the respective Shipping Lines’ depots for export container stuffing before trucking into the port for loading. Likewise, empty containers are returned to the respective depots after the import container is trucked from the port to the warehouse for unstuffing.

On average, one warehouse would handle up to 20 containers per day. With each warehouse unit having 7 to 8 loading bays, containers would be required to be parked at the trailer parking lots in KD, which has a total of 480 lots, to be trucked between the warehouse and the trailer parking lot.

The replacement facility for KD at Tuas when its lease is up is a multi-storey facility (up to 5 levels) due to land scarcity. The smaller land footprint does not allow having similar no. of trailer parking lots as KD but will need to reduce by 35% as available space for trailer parking will only be at the facility rooftop. In addition, due to the rooftop loading limitation, only empty trailer or empty container sitting on trailer can be parked at the rooftop. Laden container sitting on trailer to be parked at the warehouse loading bays only.

With the limited parking lots for Tuas CFS, there is a need to improve the logistics eco-system within the CFS. However, the hauliers generally do not share their trailer with other hauliers due to concerns on accountability should the trailer be damaged by the other haulier. Hence, almost every empty container after unstuffing are returned to the depot although there could be potential opportunity to be re-use by another tenant for export container stuffing in the CFS if the timing/schedule permits.

Although there are instances of empty container re-use, it is currently limited to the same tenant since there is no 3rd party involvement (other haulier and other tenant) that requires a handling/taking over process on the empty container condition and the trailer condition. However, this limits the scope to optimise the eco-system within the CFS to be more efficient.

## Challenge
To propose and develop solutions on how improvements to the logistics eco- system within the CFS could be achieved with closer collaboration amongst the Tenants and interfacing with the Tuas Port when the replacement CFS facility at Tuas is ready.
